# Google Keeper Clone

This is a simple clone of Google Keeper built using React.js. It currently supports Create, Read, and Delete (CRD) operations.

## Features
- Create, view, and delete notes
- No database required

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start the development server using `npm start`

## Future Plans
In the future, I plan to add support for the Update operation and integrate with MongoDB for data persistence.
